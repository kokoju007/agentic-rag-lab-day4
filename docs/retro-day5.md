# Day-5 Retro

## What went well
- Demo scenarios were clear and reproducible.
- Guardrail, doc search, and HITL paths were easy to show.

## What needs improvement
- Reduce debug-only fields before final demo.

## Risks to track
- Encoding regressions in Korean prompts or evidence.

## Next actions
- Capture demo JSON and screenshots outside the repo.
- Validate UTF-8 output before each interview.
